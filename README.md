# Sketch-Pad
Try your drawing skills out on this beautiful sketch pad. 

It's simple, hold left click to draw and hold right click to erase.

Adjust the resolution of the 32x32 grid sketch pad by entering a number in the "enter a # of squares" textbox. 
The number you submit will erase the current grid and populate a new grid with nxn resolution.
For example, if I submit 64 in the textbox, the grid will have a 64x64 resolution with more precision to draw.

What makes this sketch pad beautiful is you can pick different colors to give your sketch life!
